## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/flutter-starter/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to Flutter Starter itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

## Development

### Docs

Improvements to the documentation are always welcome. You can find them in the [`flutter-starter.github.io`](https://github.com/flutter-starter/flutter-starter.github.io) repository. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build our documentation website. The website is published automatically whenever the `master` branch is updated.

### Examples

Flutter Starter comes with [`HackerNews App`](https://flutter-starter.github.io/docs/hacker-news-example), [`GithubRepo List App`](https://flutter-starter.github.io/docs/github-repo-list-example) and [`Weather App`](https://flutter-starter.github.io/docs/weather-app-example) as examples to demonstrate various concepts and best practices.

When adding a new example, please adhere to the style and format of the existing examples, and try to reuse as much code as possible.

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/flutter-starter/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.
